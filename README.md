# Hub88 Devloper Challenge

As a hub88 developer, you will be interacting directly with the Hub88 APIs; the "Game Providers APIs" and the "Operators APIs".

An "Operator" needs to implement the API defined by the [Operator Documentation](https://hub88.io/docs/operator) in order to integrate and properly handle received requests from Game providers via Hub88.
In order to test your skills, you need to create your own "Operator Wallet API".


### Please be strict to the following development guidelines:
- Keep it simple;
- The technologies and languages are open. Choose the most comfortable stack based on your own experience;
- Do NOT implement the "signature" requirements;
- Implement the transactions endpoints properly, including corner-cases;
- Ensure that your project's code is clean and readable;
- There is no explicit deadline and you can take your time to develop it. However, please note that the position(s) can be taken during the time you are developing it;

On completion of the API, publish it publicly to any git cloud server of your choice (ex: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) and share the link with us;
After sharing your project, we will schedule your presentation/evaluation meeting.

### Please be strict to the following presentation guidelines:
- Keep it simple;
- Start by performing a live demo of your API, in accordance to Hub88 docs;
- Next, explain why you chose the language(s), framework(s), and/or other technologies included in your solution;
- Finally, explain how your API works while showing the project's source code in an editor/IDE of your choice;
- Be ready to answer technical questions related to your project.

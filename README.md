# Hub88 Developer Challenge

As a Hub88 developer, you will be interacting directly with the Hub88 APIs; the *"Game Providers APIs"* and the *"Operators APIs"*.

An "Operator" needs to implement the API defined by the [Operator Documentation](https://hub88.io/docs/operator) in order to integrate and properly handle received requests from Game providers via Hub88.

**In order to test your skills, you need to develop your own Operator's _"Wallet API"_ service implementation**

### Please be strict to the following development guidelines:
- Keep it simple;
- The technologies and languages are open. Choose the most comfortable stack based on your own experience;
- Do **NOT** implement the request's "signature" requirements;
- Implement the transactions endpoints properly, including corner-cases;
- Ensure that your source code is clean and readable;

**Note:** There are no explicit deadlines. However, do note that proceeding with your challenge is subject to the availability of the position.
Keep in touch with the recruitment contact, to plan your delivery.

On completion of the challenge, publish it publicly to any git cloud server of your choice (ex: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) and share the link with the recruitment contact;
After sharing your project, we will schedule your presentation/evaluation meeting.

### Please be strict to the following presentation guidelines:
- Keep it simple;
- Start by performing a live demo of your API, in accordance to Hub88 docs;
- Next, explain why you chose the language(s), framework(s), and/or other technologies included in your solution;
- Finally, explain how your API works while showing the project's source code in an editor/IDE of your choice;
- Be ready to answer technical questions related to your project.

For further clarifications, be in touch with the recruitment contact.
